This is to be put in "home/prg/programs/".
Certain things are required in the "home/prg" directory:
	install/SDL2/	[separate package]
	obj/		[empty folder]
	jlvm/		[this program]
	bin/jlvm/	[separate package]

	JL_LIB is a powerful library that uses OpenGL/OpenGLES with SDL2.
It is for use with SDL2, for SDL2 has no way of drawing text on the screen.
It also has no way of drawing 3D graphics without using opengl.  It uses a
version of SDL with none of the 2D rendering stuff that comes with it and
without SDL_test.  The reason this is removed is because with this it is
unneeded and would just take up precious memory on platforms that don't have
much of it.
	JL_LIB also takes care of any compatibility issues there might be between
opengl and opengles and sdl for android and sdl for PC.
	The folder under SDL2 has all of the slightly modified SDL2 stuff in it.
The folder under JLLB has the code built on top of SDL and opengl/opengles.
